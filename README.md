# How to Run
1. Check to see that you have maven installed.\
2. Open your command prompt and navigate to the root folder of the project. (This is where you can see the src folder, but are not IN the src folder)\
3. Run the command: mvn clean install
4. Once the build is successful, run the command: java -jar .\target\PoplInterpreter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
5. You should see the string "running", which is just my test printout
